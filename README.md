# CSE332
Data Structures and Algorithms class at UW Seattle, Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science. 

This repository consists of some complex data structures we implemented: HashTrieMap, ArrayStack, CircularArrayFIFOQueue, MinFourHeap. 
The types of data used in this class were created by the staff, and it is not necessary to know how they work to understand these data structures.
