This repository consists of some complex data structures we implemented in my Data structures and Algorithms class: HashTrieMap, ArrayStack, CircularArrayFIFOQueue, MinFourHeap. 
The types of data used in this class were created by the staff, and it is not necessary to know how they work to understand these data structures.
